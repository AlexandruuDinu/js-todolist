A simple To Do List with browser storage and some animations.

You can add any task you don't want to forget. It will be saved in the browser's memory as soon as you press the ADD button (Plus icon).

After completing the proposed task, use the green check mark to cut off the list. To delete an item from the list, click on the red button with the trash can icon, and it will fall through an animation and disappear from the screen.
